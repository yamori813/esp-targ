This code is targ support on NCR53C500 PCMCIA card.

Almost stable now. I use this code for PC-9801 strage.

I developed on FreeBSD 12.2R.

scsi_target command souce modify for cam direction bug.

I don't try ctl support. 

PC-9801 support code refer from RaSCSI code.

I add support for Virtual98(v98) disk image format.

makehid command is usefull at make empty disk image.

Usage

% ./makehdi -f v98 --size 40m -h 8 -s 25 dos.hdd
cylinder=391, heads=8, sectors=25, bytes per sector=512
total sectors=78200 (0x13178), size of raw image=40.0Mbytes
building cylinder 391/391 (100.0%) ... ok!

% sudo ./scsi_target -v 2:0:0 dos.hdd

Thanks
