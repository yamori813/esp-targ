This code is targ support on NCR53C500 PCMCIA card.

Not stable yet. I use this code for PC-9801 strage.

I developed on FreeBSD 12.2R.

SCSI ID is 0 fixed.

scsi_target command souce modify for cam direction bug.

I don't try ctl support. 

I refer RaSCSI code for PC-9801 support.

Usage

% dd if=/dev/zero of=vol bs=512 count=82000

% sudo ./scsi_target 2:0:0 vol

Thanks
